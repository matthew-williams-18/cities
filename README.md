# Cities
Matt Williams' repository for Cities

This application gives a GUI of American city data. Users can decide how they'd like data to displayed in addition to which data in particular is included. Users can select which state they'd like to view, and can view cities organized by city name or by city population.

## Getting started
The first step to using this application is downloading it. On the main repository screen, click "Clone or download" and select "Download ZIP". Once downloaded, simply go to where it downloaded and run the Cities.jar file.
